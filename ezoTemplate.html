<!-- This file is not used in the code.  It is just here to help explain the setup and as a template to make new ezos -->
<!-- the id of the below field must match the value passed in the ezoSelect function in the tabs -->
<div class="econfig inactive" id="DO">
    <div class="eAttributes">
       <div class="attribute">
          <!-- inside this div you must have 1 label followed by 1 div -->
          <label>label</label>
          <div>
             <!-- only input tags will have the values pulled.  
                right now only input types of radio and number will be read.  
                Can add more inside the getFormData function in main.js -->
             <input type="radio" id="DOUnitsPPM" name="THIS WILL BE THE KEY IN THE JSON FILE" value="THIS WILL BE THE VALUE IN THE JSON FILE">
             <label for="DOUnitsPPM">PPM</label><br>
             <!-- labels are not needed inside here.  you can add as many inputs as 
                you want and they can be of different types -->
          </div>
       </div>
    </div>
 </div>

 <!-- if you need to add more ezos you can just take one of the examples in main.html and do a full text replace on that ezo name
to the new ezo name (DO -> ORM )  and then add / remove inputs as needed-->
